This paper proposes a new fashion outfit recommendation task 
where an outfit is recommended after several rounds of user-system interactions.
In this task, the system is expected to present a question (a set of fashion items) at each round, 
and the user is expected to select the best fashion item from the presented items. 
The system is required to gradually learn users' preferences based on their responses and to generate 
subsequent questions for recommending a suitable outfit based on the users' selected fashion items. 
Since there was no dataset available for this task,
we developed a new dataset for evaluating interactive fashion outfit recommendations through simulation.
Based on the analysis of the developed dataset, 
we devised an experimental interactive fashion outfit recommendation algorithm based on a learning-to-rank model
with hand-crafted features. 
Moreover, we proposed a new Transformer model to achieve higher accuracy in the interactive recommendation task. 
Our model encodes questions by Transformer
and estimates the value of questions based on previous questions and given answers.
The experimental results demonstrated that 
the proposed Transformer models outperformed the learning-to-rank model,
and Set Transformer is a suitable model for embedding questions in the interactive fashion outfit recommendation task.
