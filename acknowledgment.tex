I would like to express my deep gratitude to my supervisor Professor Katsumi Tanaka.
Whenever I asked him to discuss our researches, he always spared much time for me.

When I asked for permission to go abroad, he readily let me go.
I have great estimation for his research visions, ability of abstraction, and great breadth of mind.
