\chapter{Conclusions}
\label{sq:conclusions}

This paper proposed a new fashion outfit recommendation task 
where an outfit is recommended after several rounds of user-system interactions.
We developed a new dataset for evaluating interactive fashion outfit recommendations through simulation.
Based on the analysis of the developed dataset, 
we devised interactive fashion outfit recommendation algorithms based on a learning-to-rank model and Set Transformer.
The experimental results demonstrated that 
the proposed Transformer models outperformed the learning-to-rank model,
and Set Transformer is a suitable model for embedding questions in the interactive fashion outfit recommendation task.
We hope that our work and interactive fashion recommendation dataset draw more attention to interactive fashion recommendation research.
